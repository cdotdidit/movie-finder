This is my Node101 Movie Finder project; it is a cached applicated able to make GET requests to the OMDB site. It will store requested items in a JSON file to be recalled quicker if requested again.

This project utilizes NPM, Express, Morgan, and Axios. 

To activate this project on a local server, get all of these files and then type npm start in your terminal.

Enjoy.
